What this book covers

Chapter 1, Introduction to Practical Business Intelligence, serves as the overall introduction to the book and gives a high-level understanding of what business intelligence is, the intended audience of this book, and a summary of the different technologies that will be used.

Chapter 2, Web Scraping, focuses on data extraction from the Web using web scraping libraries from both R and Python. We will also focus on importing data into our data warehouse with MS SQL Server.

Chapter 3, Analysis with Excel and Creating Interactive Maps and Charts with Power BI, focuses on using pivot tables and charts in Microsoft Excel to help with data analysis. Additionally, we build the first BI application using a map in Microsoft Power BI.

Chapter 4, Creating Bar Charts with D3.js, introduces D3.js and explains how this JavaScript library can be used to leverage visualizations developed with SVG elements as well as data from a CSV file. Ultimately, we will use both methods to develop a bar chart with SVG elements tied to data from a CSV file.

Chapter 5, Forecasting with R, introduces building line charts and time series with R. Additionally, we incorporate forecasting libraries within R to visualize them on top of the existing time series. RStudio is also introduced to assist with delivering R code to business users.

Chapter 6, Creating Histograms and Normalization Plots with Python, covers data visualizations developed with popular Python libraries. The main goal of this chapter is to build a histogram and normalization plot inside of the Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 code.

Chapter 7, Creating a Sales Dashboard with Tableau, focuses on building a dashboard using Tableau Public against a dataset developed by a Microsoft SQL Server query based on sales.

Chapter 8, Creating an Inventory Dashboard with QlikSense, focuses on building a dashboard using QlikSense against a dataset connected to Microsoft SQL Server based on an inventory of material.

Chapter 9, Data Analysis with Microsoft SQL Server, serves as a wrap-up of the technologies covered as well as some advanced querying techniques that can be employed by Microsoft SQL Server.
